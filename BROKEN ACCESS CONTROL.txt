BROKEN ACCESS CONTROL

UNPROTECTED ADMIN FUNCTIONALITY
You can find this through recon, robots.txt, fuzzing/content-discovery etc to look for an admin endpoint.

Header Based
X-ORIGIN-URL in some app frameworks.
REFERER - /admin to go to /admin/users

Bypassing URL Based Controls
Appending .extension at the end of the url.
Appending trailing slash
The header based can work here as well

Method bypass. By changing method from POST to GET and viceversa

Hidden parameters.

Identifier that is editable in the headers eg cookies or session token.

Parameters in the URL that are editable

Redirect but using view source to reveal sensitive info.



PREVENTION
Defense in depth.
Never rely on obsfucation.
use single application-wide mechanism for access control.
Deny access by default enable for userid - in code.
Tests and audits.
